**Conclusion:** Unable to show any distinct features of cats or dogs due to
the dataset having too much variability in the images. Further study is needed
with manually looking over the images in the dataset.

We will train a model using CNN and then test the performance.''')

augmenting or fine tuning hyperparameters.

Augmenting training set images will greatly improve performance.''')

Test model without augmented images first and then compare results.''')

**Conclusion:** Confirmed, augmenting images improved model accuracy by approximately 10%. However it also increased time to train the model by 42%.

Fine tuning hyperparameters will significantly improve the models accuracy.''')

Test the model with base settings and then attempt to increase the score.''')

**Conclusion:** Confirmed, hyperparameters play a huge role in model performance. Testing different values had a big effect on prediction accuracy.

**Hypohesis 5:** Training the model with images that has higher
resolution will improve accuracy.''')

    st.warning('''
**How to validate:** Create datasets with different image quality,
then train and test the model with each dataset.''')

    st.error('''
**Conclusion:** Hypothesis is incorrect. Higher resolution images does
not always equal better model performance.

Training the model on images 25% of the average size
resulted in 20% less accuracy but incredibly fast training time.
Training the model on images 50% of the average size resulted in
better similar accuracy and 80% faster to train the model.
This shape will be used going forward.
